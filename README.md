1. What is wrong with the component you chose?
   There are two main issues that I identified with the cards on the products grid.
   1: The white text on the light blue background scores a 2.88 on a contrast test which is too low for the text size on the card.
   2: The important part of the card is hidden from the user by a hover state

2. How will you improve it?
   To improve the component I will take away the hover effect and make the text more readable, whilst keeping all the content present.

3. Given more time what would you further improve?
   Given more time I would look into reducing the height of each card. Currently, the button section is taking up to much space. I have designed a second version of the card that has a single "Learn more" button that would take the user to their respective insurance page (See link below). For example, the Learn more pet insurance would take them to "https://www.theinsuranceemporium.co.uk/products/pet". This page includes all the call to action buttons taken from the card on the homepage. This change would take some research to see how removing the "Get quote" affects the user flow.
